# DuckLake â€“ Reference Data architecture for SmallÂ & Midâ€‘Size companies

![DuckLake architecture diagram](docs/imgs/ducklake_architexture.excalidraw.png)

**DuckLake** is an opinionated, endâ€‘toâ€‘end example that shows how you can combine  
**DuckDBâ€¯+â€¯DuckLakeâ€¯+â€¯dbtâ€¯+â€¯Pythonâ€¯+â€¯PowerÂ BI** to build a productionâ€‘ready analytics stack on a single developer workstation.

The repository demonstrates:

| Capability | Technology | Where it happens |
|------------|------------|------------------|
| **Ingestion** from public (web) sources | PythonÂ (`uv`) | `ingestion/` |
| **Bronzeâ€¯/â€¯Silverâ€¯/â€¯Gold tables** & automatic cataloging | DuckDBÂ +Â DuckLake | `lakehouse/` |
| **SQL transformations, testing, docs** | dbt | `transformation/` |
| **Interactive exploration & serving** | DuckDBÂ CLIÂ /Â DuckDBÂ UI | everywhere |
| **Selfâ€‘service BI** | PowerÂ BI (DuckDB connector) | outside repo |
| **Oneâ€‘click pipeline run** | PowerShellÂ (`run_pipeline.ps1`) | repo root |

## 1Â Â QuickÂ Start

> ### Prerequisites  
> * **PythonÂ â‰¥â€¯3.12**  
> * **git CLI** 
> * **DuckDB CLI**Â â€“ `duckdb` must be on yourÂ PATH
>   ```powershell
>   # Oneâ€‘liner install (Windows, PowerShell)
>   winget install DuckDB.cli
>   ```   
> * **uv** â€“ lightningâ€‘fast Python dependency manager  
>   ```powershell
>   # Oneâ€‘liner install (Windows, PowerShell)
>   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
>   ```  
>   
> Tested on **WindowsÂ 10/11**. The stack is crossâ€‘platform, so it should run on macOS/Linux as well â€“ simply translate the PowerShell script into your shell of choice.

Powershell â‰¥6:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/999999333/ducklake_elt_diabetes.git
cd ducklake_elt_diabetes
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass -Force
./run_pipeline.ps1          # grab a coffeeÂ â˜•
```

The script performs the following:

1. Ensures **uv** is installed and syncs dependencies into a local **.venv**  
2. Executes ingestion scripts (`raw_download.py`, `ingest_dwh.py`)  
3. Activates the venv and runs **dbt runâ€¯/â€¯docsâ€¯/â€¯build**  
4. Starts the **DuckDB UI** so you can inspect the catalog  
5. Deactivates the venv and returns you to the starting directory  

When everything succeeds you'll see **âœ“Â AllÂ steps completed successfully.**  
Hit **ENTER** and your lakehouse is ready to start querying!

### 1.1 Manual run (in case that you can't get `run_pipeline.ps1` working)
Download this git and unzip it somewhere (eg. your documents). Open CLI and navigate to that folder `cd`.. and then start running those commands, one by one 
```
uv sync
uv run ingestion/raw_download.py
uv run ingestion/ingest_dwh.py
./.venv/Scripts/activate
cd transformation
dbt run
dbt docs generate --static
start target/static_index.html
dbt build
cd ..
uv run ingestion/setup_duck_db.ui
duckdb -ui
```

## 4Â Â WorkingÂ with the Data

### 4.1Â Â Explore in DuckDBÂ UI
```bash
duckdb -ui
```
After populatting (running orchestration powershell) open <http://localhost:4321> to browse tables, run adâ€‘hoc SQL, or export slices to ParquetÂ /Â CSV.

### 4.2Â Â Build & test in dbt
```bash
cd transformation
dbt run            # build Bronzeâ†’Silverâ†’Gold
dbt build          # build + tests (expect one deliberate failing testÂ ðŸ™‚)
dbt docs serve     # interactive lineage & docs site
```

## 5Â Â TroubleshootingÂ Guide

| Step         | Symptom                              | Suggested fix |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|---------------|
| `uv sync`    | Python version mismatch              | Upgrade Python / adjust `pyproject.toml` |
| `ingest_dwh` | Cannot openÂ *.duckdb*                | Check path & file permissions |
| venv activate| Execution policy blocks scripts      | `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass` |
| `dbt run`    | Connection fails                     | `dbt debug` inside `transformation/` |
| `dbt build`  | Test fails                           | This is intentional â€“ inspect the failing test to see dbt data quality in action |

The **run_pipeline.ps1** script prints friendly hints for each failure and never leaves your shell in a broken state.
